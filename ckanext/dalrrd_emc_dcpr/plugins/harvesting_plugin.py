    This class exists in order to work around a bug in ckanext-spatial:

        https://github.com/ckan/ckanext-spatial/issues/277

    The mentioned bug prevents being able to have a CKAN extension plugin using both
    the `IValidators` and the `ISpatialHarvester` interfaces at the same time.

    As an alternative, we have implemented the current plugin class with the aim
    to use it strictly for customization of the harvesters (_i.e._ implement the
    ISpatialHarvester interface) while the main plugin class
    (emc_dcpr_plugin.DalrrdEmcDcprPlugin) is still handling all of the other EMC-DCPR
    customizations.
